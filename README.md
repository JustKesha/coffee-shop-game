## üå∂Ô∏è Latest changes

* You can now pour certain ingredients like `milk` into cups.

## üßä Ingredients

Currently there are two ingidients in the game:
- `Milk`
- And `coffee mixture`

Some of them, like `milk` are interactable: You can start pouring it while you hold it.

You make coffee by combining named ingredients in a cup, to do so just drag & drop or slowly pour the ingredients in it.

## ‚òï Coffee Math

Currently you can make a total of 5 drinks out of these two ingredients:
1. `Espresso` (100% coffee, 0% milk)
1. `Espresso Macchiato` (75/25)
1. `Flat White` (25/75)
1. `Cappuccino` (20/80)
1. `Latte` (14.3/85.3)

This customer dummy will analyse your drink, by:

1. *Calculating the average match percentage between the ingredients ratio in the recipe and the ingredients ratio in the cup.*

To make sure you get it's order right, or at least close enough!
